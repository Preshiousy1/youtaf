                            YOUTAF is a non-profit organization based in Alberta, Canada aimed at raising young people
                            (called Talented Fellows) to become community leaders in diverse communities cutting across
                            various fields of endeavour. We are working towards becoming the most influential and most
                            accessible youth run organization in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Vision</h5>
                            A limitless society where youths can showcase their potentials to the fullest
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Mission</h5>
                            Empowering underrepresented youths, helping them unleash their potentials even as they
                            contribute to national development.
                        </p>
                        <h5>What we've achieved so far</h5>
                        <p>
                            The organization was founded in March 2018 in Algeria by a group of talented college
                            graduates. Since then we have organized several educational conferences,provided young
                            leaders with leadership and career development trainings and empowered so many young people
                            with business ideas.
                            We partnered with African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT) in 2018 for
                            an Inter-generational dialogue on Creating Safe Spaces for the Youth to mark/celebrate the
                            international day of the youth.
                            We currently have 25 volunteers from different parts of the world.
